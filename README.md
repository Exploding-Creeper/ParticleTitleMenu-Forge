# Particle Title Menu

## Details
Overrides the default Minecraft Title Menu with moving particles that can interact with each other and the mouse.  Comes with a config which allows fine-tuned control over particle behavior as well as their look and feel.  If things don't work right, please open an issue, so I can look into it.
